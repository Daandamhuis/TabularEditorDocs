# C# Script Helper Methods

When writing C# scripts in Tabular Editor, a number of global methods (i.e. methods that can be called without prefixing a class or object name) are available.

The full list of these can be found in the [`API documentation`](xref:TabularEditor.Shared.Scripting.ScriptHost#methods).

Below is a summary of these methods. Click on a method name to browse the API documentation for that method.
