# General introduction and architecture

Tabular Editor is a Windows desktop application for developing tabular models. Specifically, the tool lets you edit the Tabular Object Model (TOM) metadata.

> We use the term "tabular model" to represent both Analysis Services Tabular models as well as Power BI datasets, since Analysis Services Tabular is the data model engine used by Power BI.
