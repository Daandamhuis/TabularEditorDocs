- Resetting the window layout through the **Window** menu, now no longer affects toolbar buttons (these can be modified or reset through the **Tools > Customize** dialog).

- Fixed the missing context menu option to refresh a Calculated Table or Calculation Group.
- Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause a crash when attempting to perform a schema update.
- It is now no longer possible to debug a measure that has been removed from the model (which would otherwise cause a crash).
