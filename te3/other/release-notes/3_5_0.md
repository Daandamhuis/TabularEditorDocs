### Prerequisites

Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (and newer) uses .NET 6. You may have to install the [.NET 6.0 Runtime for Desktop](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) before you can launch Tabular Editor 3.3.0 (or newer). Starting from 3.3.1, the Tabular Editor 3 installer will download and install these prerequisites, if they are missing.

## Improvements in 3.5.0

- Updated TOM to [19.57.2.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AnalysisServices.retail.amd64/).
- This release introduces **Table Groups** which lets you organise tables into "folders" in the TOM Explorer. [Learn more](xref:table-groups).
- Default shortcut for uncommenting code now set to Ctrl+U
- Tabular Editor will now attempt to automatically reconnect to Analysis Services, when the session timeout has expired. This means it should no longer be necessary to close and reopen table previews, DAX query windows and Pivot Grids. See [#650](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/650), [#803](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor3/issues/803).
- Added a new set of overloaded C# script methods `Macro(...)`. These are an alias for `CustomAction(...)`. The API documentation has been updated accordingly.
- When using Tabular Editor in **Workspace Mode**, incremental refresh partitions are not overridden upon workspace database updates. Moreover, a new serialization option **Ignore incremental refresh partitions** is now available, and enabled by default for new models. This option will make sure that partitions governed by incremental refresh, are not serialized when saving a model as a .bim or folder structure. This makes it easier to integrate models using incremental refresh with version control.
- Added toolbar button to toggle display folders in the **Perspective Editor view**. Toggling a Display Folder in the Perspective Editor, will toggle all objects within that folder.
- Tabular Editor now has full support for Oracle data sources. You must have the [ODP.NET managed drivers](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/odac-downloads.html) installed, which is also a requirement if you want to import data from Oracle in Power BI Desktop.

## Bugfixes in 3.5.0
- Auto-format should no longer erase code when the DAX Editor is configured to use tabs
- "Open macro" button in the **Macros** view will now be enabled whenever a macro is selected
- It should no longer be necessary to reset the window layout, in order for the **Perspective Editor** view to appear
- Main Menu bar will no longer reset when a macro is added as a new button
- Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented Tabular Editor from opening a .bim file or .json folder structure containing Power BI specific TOM properties.
- `ResolveObjectPath` now supports the "old" path format, similar to TE2. See [#1077](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/issues/1077).
- BPA rules that rely on the `Expression` property on tables, should no longer fail.
- Macros can now be saved/compiled even if their name contains a double quote.
- Fixed various issues with the `CustomAction(...)` C# script method.
- Perspective Editor now correctly deals with hidden tables containing visible measures.
- Fixed an issue that prevented setting the **Default Measure** property on the Model object through the **Properties View**.
- **Calculate Table** context menu option will no longer show when working offline.
- Fixed an issue that caused the C# autocomplete dropdown to "absorb" a period key press.
- Fixed an issue with the semantic analyzer reporting incorrect parameter usage to the DAX [XIRR](https://dax.guide/xirr) function.
